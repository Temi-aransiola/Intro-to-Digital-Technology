         color: rgb(255,255,255)">  In this lesson we learnt how to use Tinkercad .An online platform used for 3D modeling, electronics, and coding, Mr brash  had lessons and activities designed to help users get started with Tinkercad's tools and features. Once we learnt how to use tinkercad we had a project were we made a 3d design of an obeject we need. i decided to make a 3d magnetic lock safe, although I didn't get to print it Mr brash said my 3d model was well thought out.
