      <a style="background-color: #222222;color:#f7faf8"> In Bits and Bytes I learned how to convert binary to decimal and decimal to binary. I also learned how about hexadecimal and other number systems. A wire can have electricity flowing or not. Binary is a number system with 1 and 0 and can be converted to decimal or binary. Adding and subtracting binary involve carry over and borrowing techniques.Computers use binary bits to represent data, and theoretical 'Logic Gates' control the flow of logic through transistors to create circuits.
