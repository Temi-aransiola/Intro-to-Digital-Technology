      <a style="background-color: #222222;color:#f7faf8"> The goal of this lesson was to understand the basics of electricity, including voltage, current, and wattage. Atoms make up the world, and they have negatively charged electrons called valence electrons that can jump from atom to atom. When these electrons move, they change the charge of each atom. Electricity is the flow of electrons, and opposites attract and repel. One Amp (A) represents approximately 6,241,509,074,460,762,607 electrons (a Coulomb) passing a point in one second. Amperage, also called current, is the availability of electrons, and one Volt (V) represents the electrical potential between two points. Power (Watts) = Volts x Amps.The lesson also covers Ohm's Law, which states that a power source can only push so hard (voltage) that if you can resist the flow (increase resistance), then less current can flow.Resistance is measured in Ohms (Î©), and it is measured in Ohms (V = IR). A resistor is a device that forces atoms to shake, creating heat and potentially light. Ohm's law states that V = IR, where R represents resistance value in Ohms.The Unit concluded with a discussion on Ohm's law and the importance of reading resistance using a multimeter. The lesson also includes a practical application of circuits, such as turning on an LED in Tinkercad, and the ability to control the brightness of an LED independently.
In conclusion, the electricity unit provides a comprehensive understanding of electricity, Ohm's law, and circuits. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the connection between power and resistance, as well as the importance of lab safety.</a>
