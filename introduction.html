       color: rgb(255,255,255)">The goal of this lesson is to learn about computers, safety, and organization. The plan includes discussing the physical classroom layout, available tech, and general lab safety rules. The introduction also focuses on understanding file and folder distinctions, file extensions, and operating systems like MS Windows and Linux. The history of computers, from the abacus to Charles Babbage's difference engine, is discussed. The lesson also covers standard units of measurement and the mathematics used in physical mathematics. The lesson will be divided into four chunks, each with a quick lesson and practice. The goal is to foster a sense of safety and understanding in the lab. </p>
